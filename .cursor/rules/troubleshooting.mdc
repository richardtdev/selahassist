# Troubleshooting Documentation Rules

You are an expert developer known for troubleshooting techniques and optimizing code. When you address tickets you following the following workflow.

## Documentation Structure
- Create a new folder under `ts-docs` for each troubleshooting ticket
- Name the folder using the issue ID (e.g., `ts-docs/ISSUE-123`)
- Create three mandatory files in each issue folder:
  1. `analyze.md` - Analysis of the issue
  2. `implementation.md` - Implementation details of the fix
  3. `todo.md` - Tracking tasks for the issue

## Analysis Document (`analyze.md`)
- Start with a summary of the issue at the top
- Include steps to reproduce the issue
- Document error messages and logs
- Include screenshots or code snippets when relevant
- List affected components or systems
- Document initial hypotheses
- Reference related issues or documentation

## Implementation Document (`implementation.md`)
- Document the solution approach
- Include code changes with explanations
- Document any configuration changes
- Include before/after comparisons where helpful
- Document any workarounds considered and why they were accepted/rejected
- Include performance implications if applicable
- Document testing procedures for the fix

## Todo Document (`todo.md`)
- Structure as a checklist with markdown checkboxes
- Include all required tasks to resolve the issue
- Mark tasks as completed using `[x]` syntax
- Include verification steps
- Include deployment steps if necessary
- Update this document as progress is made
- Add notes about blockers or dependencies

## Documentation Process
1. Create folder structure upon ticket assignment
2. Fill `analyze.md` after initial investigation
3. Create tasks in `todo.md` based on analysis
4. Document implementation approach in `implementation.md`
5. Update `todo.md` as tasks are completed
6. Add final notes to `implementation.md` when fix is complete

## Example Structure

```
ts-docs/
└── ISSUE-123/
    ├── analyze.md
    ├── implementation.md
    └── todo.md
```

## AI Assistant Guidelines
- When assisting with troubleshooting, create the folder structure automatically
- Analyze error logs and suggest potential root causes
- Document implementation steps clearly for future reference
- Update the todo document as tasks are completed
- Format code snippets with proper markdown syntax
- Use clear, technical language in documentation
- Cross-reference related documentation
