# SermonAssist Development Task List and RACI Chart

## Overview
This document outlines the development tasks for the SermonAssist SaaS Platform, assigning responsibilities to AI agents acting as frontend and backend developers. Each responsible developer must break down their assigned task into a child task list of specific subtasks before starting implementation. This ensures thorough planning and clarity in execution. The child task list should follow the example format provided below and be documented in the projectâ€™s `ts-docs` directory (e.g., `ts-docs/TASK-T1-child-tasks.md`).

### Example Child Task List Format
For a task like "Implement user authentication UI" (T1):
